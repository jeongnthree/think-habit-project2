## Test Execution

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="integration"

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="progress-tracking-integration.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="journal-workflow-integration.test.ts"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="api-endpoints.test.ts"
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific E2E test
npx playwright test journal-complete-flows.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Test Data and Mocking

### Mock Data Structures

- **Users**: Student, coach, and admin user profiles
- **Categories**: Training categories with task templates
- **Journals**: Both structured and photo journal examples
- **Progress**: Weekly progress tracking data
- **Task Templates**: Structured task definitions with validation rules

### Database Mocking

- Comprehensive Supabase client mocking
- Transaction simulation and rollback testing
- Constraint violation handling
- Performance optimization validation

### API Mocking

- Request/response cycle simulation
- Error condition testing
- Rate limiting and security validation
- File upload and storage testing

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:

- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Coverage reporting and quality gates
- Performance regression detection
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive error scenarios
3. Test both happy path and edge cases
4. Validate requirements coverage
5. Update this README with new test descriptions

### Test Data Updates

- Keep mock data synchronized with actual schema
- Update validation rules when business logic changes
- Maintain realistic test scenarios
- Document any test-specific configurations

## Quality Metrics

The test suite aims for:

- **Code Coverage**: >90% for critical paths
- **Requirement Coverage**: 100% of specified requirements
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: All major error conditions
- **Performance Validation**: Response time and resource usage limits
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards
